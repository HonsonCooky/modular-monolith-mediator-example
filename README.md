# Modular Monolith MediatR Example

## Problem Statement

A `Modular Monolith` using `Clean Architecture` with the `MediatR` library in C# is a particular topic I've recently 
encountered. Upon thinking about how these ideas can come together, I've created this example project to help 
communicate the way in which I believe these concepts come together cohesively.

_Note: Concepts above are broadly explained here, but it's important that you look into these concepts individually 
first before interacting with the ideas below._
